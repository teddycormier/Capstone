# NOTE
This prototype was initially developed for compatibility with a standard 27-inch monitor. However, the current implementation lacks full support for smaller monitor displays regarding the viewport height (vh). For optimal user experience across various screen sizes, it is recommended to utilize devices with screen dimensions similar to or larger than a 27-inch monitor until the necessary adjustments are made to accommodate smaller screens effectively.
